# Google Drive Integration

## Setting Up Google Drive Access

This application requires access to Google Drive to create newsletters. Follow these steps to set up Google Drive integration:

1. **Using Clerk OAuth with Google**:
   - Sign in to the application with your Google account through Clerk
   - Visit the [test page](/test-google-drive) to verify your connection
   - If you're experiencing issues, use the Direct Google Auth setup

2. **Direct Google Auth Setup**:
   - Visit the [Direct Google Auth Setup page](/test-google-drive/direct-auth)
   - Click "Connect to Google Drive"
   - Authorize the application in the Google consent screen
   - After successful authorization, you'll be redirected back
   - Your Google Drive access is now set up!

3. **Required Google Scopes**:
   - The application needs the following Google API scopes:
     - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly` (for accessing Drive files)
     - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send` (for sending newsletters)

4. **Troubleshooting**:
   - If you encounter 401 Unauthorized errors, try the Direct Google Auth Setup
   - Ensure your Google account has the necessary permissions
   - Check that the OAuth credentials are properly configured in your environment
